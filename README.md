This project implements a software to simulate the spread of forest fires. The focus is not on absolute physical accuracy (as in complex forest engineering models), 
but rather on applying concepts of Distributed Systems and Parallel Computing to solve a dynamic problem. \
The project will use a simplified, probability-based approach, avoiding complex differential equations. The simulation engine will be based on the `Cellular Automata (CA)` model.
